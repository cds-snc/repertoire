# Breadcrumb

This component is used to create breadcrumb links at the top of a page for navigation.

<Playground>
  <Breadcrumb>
    <a href="#">Page 1</a>
    <a href="#">Page 2</a>
    <span>Page 3</span>
  </Breadcrumb>
</Playground>

This component isn't currently as easy to customize as some of the others! If you need a very differently styled breadcrumb, you can check out
the source code for how the Breadcrumb is built and create your own custom breadcrumb component from the base component.
